# 💰 Daily Budget Pro — Smart Expense Tracker App

A personal finance tracker built using Python, Streamlit, and SQLite — perfect for students & professionals to manage income, expenses, and savings with ease.


## 📌 Project Overview
Daily Budget Pro is a clean, beginner-friendly budgeting app that helps you manage your daily expenses, track income, and stay on top of your savings goals. Built with a full login system and dynamic visualizations, it’s a perfect example of how real-world Python projects can be both functional and beautiful.


📝 **Note** : As a first-year B.Tech CSE student, this is just the beginning of my journey into app development and real-world projects. I'm excited to learn and grow, and this project marks the first of many steps I plan to take!


## 🧠 Why I Built This?
Being a first-year B.Tech student, I wanted to step beyond the classroom and create something practical — not just a “to-do list” app. I saw a real need for better financial management tools, especially for students and young professionals. This project helped me:

1. Understand both frontend (UI) and backend logic

2. Work with local databases (SQLite)

3. Visualize real-time data


## 🚀 Features

✅ Login / Signup authentication (local SQLite based)

✅ Add income, expenses & savings in a few clicks

✅ Filter records by date, category, or type

✅ Interactive charts (Pie chart)

✅ All data stored locally in expenses.db


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

Streamlit

Pandas

Plotly & Altair for visualization

SQLite (Local DB)

Spyder IDE + Anaconda


## 🔧 How to Run Locally

**STEP 1** : Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Krishah27/daily-budget-pro
cd daily-budget-pro

**STEP 2** : Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**STEP 3** : Run the app:

streamlit run main.py

The app will open in your default browser at http://localhost:8501.

💡 This app does not include a pre-filled database. When you run it, a new expenses.db will be created automatically for you.


## 📝 Requirements

streamlit==1.32.0
pandas==2.2.1
plotly==5.19.0
altair==5.2.0
Pillow==10.2.0

SQLite is built-in with Python. No need to install it separately.

## 🌟 What Makes This Project Unique?

There are many expense tracking apps out there — but here’s what makes Daily Budget Pro stand out from the crowd:

✅ Offline-First, No Sign-Up Needed
→ Unlike apps like Mint or Spendee which require constant internet & account setup, this runs entirely on your local machine. Just open and use !

✅ Lightweight & Beginner-Friendly
→ Many financial apps are loaded with complex dashboards and require sign-ins or subscriptions. This app has a clean, minimal interface perfect for new users and students.

✅ Built Completely with Python + Streamlit
→ No external UI libraries, no JS or backend frameworks. Just Python — showing the power of simple tools !

✅ Customizable for Any Use Case
→ Want to track hostel expenses? Add categories? Modify income logic? You can easily edit the code — unlike closed-source tools.

✅ Educational Project, Not Just a Tool
→ This isn't just an app — it's a complete solo-built project showcasing Python, database management (SQLite), data visualization, and UI logic. Great for learning and portfolio-building.

✅ No Tracking or Ads
→ Unlike mobile apps that track data or show ads, this app is 100% privacy-respecting. Your data stays on your device.

✅ Anaconda + Spyder Ready
→ Most budget apps run on cloud/web platforms. This is made with beginners in mind — fully compatible with Anaconda and Spyder IDE.
